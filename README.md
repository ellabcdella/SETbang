<br/>Please refer to the above video for details.

## üíª Introduction
* Increased demand for shared office due to increased demand for single-person & small-scale business start-ups.
* The current shared office in Korea lacks user convenience when using services, and the services are not diverse.
* For that reason we developed a shared office support website that enhances user convenience and as well as business connection when using the services.
